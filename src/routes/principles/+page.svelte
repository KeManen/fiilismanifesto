		<h1><b>Principles behind the Fiilis Manifesto</b></h1>
		<br /><br /><br />
		<h2>We follow these principles:</h2>
		<br /><br />

		<p>Our top priority is to have good Fiilis with continuous delivery of valuable software.</p>

		<p>
			We welcome changing requirements, even late in development, as they provide opportunities to
			infuse more Fiilis into our products.
		</p>

		<p>We deliver working software frequently when it ready for the maximum Fiilis.</p>

		<p>Developers must work freely with Fiilis not impeded by Business people.</p>

		<p>
			We believe in empowering motivated individuals within an environment designed to boost Fiilis,
			providing them with the support they need to spread positivity and Fiilis.
		</p>

		<p>
			The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development
			team is face-to-face conversation.
		</p>

		<p>Fiilis is the primary measure of progress in software development.</p>

		<p>
			Fiilis processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should
			be able enjoy the process indefinitely.
		</p>

		<p>
			Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design is essential for maintaining and
			enhancing the Fiilis experienced by all stakeholders.
		</p>

		<p>
			Simplicity is crucial for maximizing Fiilis in our work, as it allows us to focus on
			delivering what truly brings joy and satisfaction.
		</p>

		<p>The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from Fiilis.</p>

		<p>
			At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to enhance the Fiilis by tuning and adjusting
			behavior to amplify positivity and satisfaction.
